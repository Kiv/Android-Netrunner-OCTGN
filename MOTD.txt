=====Message of the Day======

I've now added a little something special to ANR for OCTGN.

Go to the deck editor, and look for the card with the name "Divided by Zer0". ;)

That card is wholly unofficial, much like the HB Chronos Protocol and The Collective. But someone drew me and I decided to make an ID out of it. 
If you do try it out, lemme know how it goes :D
